 <summary><h3>From Nutritionist to Software Engineer: My Journey</h3></summary>
 In 2020, as the world grappled with a global pandemic, I found myself at a crossroads. I had built a career as a nutritionist but felt a yearning for something new. It was during this time that I embarked on a path of transformation, making a bold decision to shift gears and dive headfirst into the world of coding.

My inspiration came from close friends in the tech industry, whose passion and innovation were contagious. Building my first gaming PC opened my eyes to the limitless possibilities that technology offered, sparking a newfound curiosity within me.

As I delved into coding, I discovered a profound connection between my creative spirit and front-end web development. Designing visually captivating user interfaces and crafting seamless user experiences gave me that same exhilarating itch as content creation did.

In February 2022, I took a leap of faith, leaving my nutritionist job behind to fully commit to my web development journey. The path was challenging, but my determination never wavered. I knew I was on the right track.

Summer 2023 marked a significant milestone in my journey as I secured a software engineering internship. The experience was transformative, providing invaluable insights into the life of a software engineer. It brought clarity, reaffirming my passion for this field.

I am immensely grateful for the knowledge and skills I gained during the internship. It served as a bridge between theory and practice, equipping me to tackle real-world challenges. And now, with renewed vigor, I continue my quest to advance my skills, fueled by a burning passion for software engineering and an unwavering commitment to my craft.

The journey from nutritionist to software engineer has been nothing short of extraordinary. It's a testament to the power of determination, resilience, and the boundless opportunities that emerge when one dares to chase their dreams.
